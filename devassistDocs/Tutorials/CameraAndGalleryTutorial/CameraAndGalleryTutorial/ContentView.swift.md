# CameraAndGallery Tutorial 

## Overview
This tutorial will demonstrate how to use SwiftUI to create a simple app that allows users to access their camera or image gallery to take pictures and save them. 

## Props
- `isShown` is a `Binding` that is used to determine if the camera and gallery view should be shown. 
- `image` is a `Binding` that holds the image that was selected by the user. 

## Variables
- `picker` is an `UIImagePickerController` which is used to select an image from the camera or image gallery. 

## Methods
- `makeCoordinator` is used to create a new `Coordinator` object. This is used to handle the image selection. 
- `makeUIViewController` is used to create and configure the `UIImagePickerController`. 
- `updateUIViewController` is used to update the `UIImagePickerController` when the view changes. 

## Usage
To use this tutorial, create a new SwiftUI project and add the `CaptureImageView` struct to the `ContentView`. Then, add a `Button` to the `ContentView` to trigger the camera and gallery view and a `Image` to display the selected image. Finally, bind the `isShown` and `image` props to the view's state.
