# SceneDelegate.swift

## Overview
This class is an implementation of the `UISceneDelegate` protocol that is responsible for handling the lifecycle of a scene in a `UIWindowScene` object. It configures, attaches, and manages the `UIWindow` object and the `UIHostingController` object that serves as the window's root view controller.

## Props
- `window`: A `UIWindow` object that is the window associated with the scene.

## Variables
None.

## Methods
- `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)`: This method is called when the scene is connecting to a session. It sets up the `UIWindow` and the `UIHostingController` objects with the scene's `UIWindowScene` object.
- `sceneDidDisconnect(_:)`: This method is called when the scene is being released by the system. It is a good time to release any resources associated with the scene that can be re-created the next time the scene connects.
- `sceneDidBecomeActive(_:)`: This method is called when the scene has moved from an inactive state to an active state. It is a good time to restart any tasks that were paused (or not yet started) when the scene was inactive.
- `sceneWillResignActive(_:)`: This method is called when the scene will move from an active state to an inactive state.
- `sceneWillEnterForeground(_:)`: This method is called as the scene transitions from the background to the foreground.
- `sceneDidEnterBackground(_:)`: This method is called as the scene transitions from the foreground to the background.

## Usage
The `SceneDelegate` class should be used to handle the lifecycle of the scene. It should be used to setup and manage the `UIWindow` and `UIHostingController` objects associated with the scene. It should also be used to handle the transitions from active to inactive states and from foreground to background.
