# ContentView

## Overview
ContentView is a SwiftUI view that provides an interface for a user to select an image from the device's camera or photo library. The view displays a button for the user to open the camera or photo library, and displays the selected image. 

## Props
- `image`: Image? - The selected image
- `showCaptureImageView`: Bool - A boolean indicating whether the view to open the camera or photo library should be shown

## Variables
None

## Methods
- `makeCoordinator()`: Creates a Coordinator object for the view
- `makeUIViewController`: Creates a UIImagePickerController object
- `updateUIViewController`: Updates the UIImagePickerController object

## Usage
To use ContentView, instantiate it in a SwiftUI view and bind the `showCaptureImageView` and `image` props to state variables. When the button is pressed, `showCaptureImageView` should be toggled to open the camera or photo library view. When an image is chosen, the `image` prop will be updated with the selected image.
